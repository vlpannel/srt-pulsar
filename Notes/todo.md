# TO DO

## Learning/Studying
- figure out how to make a spectrum graph in GRC
- learn about threshold detectors and get help w/ that from John
- understand the PFB block in GNU Radio and finish reading PFB paper

## Coding and GRC
- adapt binning code for numpy
- write flowgraph that processes Digital RF data complex samples with PFB (polyphase filter bank) like the paper Kiyo posted

## Other SRT Developments
- poke people to get more data on PSR B0329+54 (~1.4 Hz) and the Crab (PSR B0531+21; ~30 Hz)
	- only need 5-10 "good minutes" b/c Doppler shifts matter
	- MISA
	- 25 MHz (or as much bandwidth as possible)
