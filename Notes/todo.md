# TO DO

## Learning/Studying
- figure out how to make a spectrum graph in GRC
- learn about threshold detectors and get help w/ that from John

## Coding and GRC
- adapt binning code for numpy
- write flowgraph that processes Digital RF data complex samples with PFB (polyphase filter bank) like the paper Kiyo posted
- store filtered (via PFB) data in DRF format, then read

## Other SRT Developments
