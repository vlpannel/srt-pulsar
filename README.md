# SRT Pulsar Processing

The Small Radio Telescope (SRT) is a framework for setting up a 2-meter dish antenna, (now software-defined) radio, and accompanying software to be able to teach and practice radio astronomy techniques. It was developed by the MIT Haystack Observatory. The SRT software was updated in 2020 to be based in Python rather than C and utilizes GNU Radio for some of its data processing pipelines.

This is a project to add the ability for the SRT software to process pulsar data and generate power profiles that reflect the presence of a pulsar by showing characteristic spikes in power.
