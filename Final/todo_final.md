# TO DO:
- fix the embedded Python block in pulsar simulator to take into account time and adjust (ie., multiply) signal source depending on whether or not pulse is ocurring
- run pulsar simulator and save data to a DRF file
- run PFB and folding flowgraphs on saved "pulsar" data to test if it works
