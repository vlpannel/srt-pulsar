# SRT-py Progress (UROP Summer 2022, Viveca Pannell)

## Daily Work

### 5/23/2022
- Set up Anaconda and installed both mamba and GNU Radio (did not just miniforge or Miniconda).
- Connected to Nooelec NESDR and received signals (using CubicSDR).
- Created flow graph in GNU Radio based on the one in the presentation; no RTL-SDR source yet (cannot find that block?).

### 5/25/2022
- Downloaded osmosdr, digital_rf, and other modules to allow connection between GNU Radio and RTL-SDR.
- Explored WVURAIL DSPIRA modules, watching Introduction to Signals lecture.
- (With help) got GlobalProtect MIT VPN and NoMachine installed and functioning.
